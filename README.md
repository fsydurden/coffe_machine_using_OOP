# ‚òï Coffee Machine using OOP (Python)

This is the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** version of my earlier Coffee Machine project. It's a console-based simulation of a coffee vending machine, now refactored using clean and modular OOP principles for better structure, readability, and maintainability.

## üîß Features

- Choose from popular drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Tracks machine resources: water, milk, and coffee.
- Processes coin payments and calculates change.
- Checks if resources are sufficient for the selected drink.
- Admin report showing current resources and money collected.
- Modular and easy-to-read object-oriented code.
